# llm-games

I was wondering which games can be played entirely in LLMs. So, I created a few.

## Why?

Games provide a unique testing ground for hallucinations. They require deterministic output for every input with some RnG involved at times.  It's also a great test for context length.

## Games:

1. TicTacToe
2. Flappy Bird
3. 20 Questions
4. Rock Paper Scissors
5. Hangman

## How to play:

1. Go to Claude/Gemini/Deepseek/ChatGPT
2. Use one of the prompts given in the games folder to start.
